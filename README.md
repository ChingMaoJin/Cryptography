# Cryptography - DES
This branch shows my implementation of DES encryption and decryption without using python cryptographic library. 

# Execution
You must install python package and ensure that you are on the right directory before running the command below
On Terminal: python DES.py

# Outcome
This program requires user interaction in selecting the key format as it accept any user provided key of any length. I tested the program with the file "DES-test2025".
