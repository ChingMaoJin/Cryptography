# Cryptography
This repository shows how I apply letter frequency analysis for decrypting the cipher text. It's based on the English Letter Frequency. Futher details on how I decrypt the ciphertext can be found on the report named "22013213_MaoJin_Ching_ReportA1"

# Executing the file
On terminal: python LetterFreqAnalysis.py

# Outcome
You will get a barchart showing the frequency of each alphabet then close the window. You will find the decrypted text in the file named "Letter_Freq_Analysis_DecryptedText"
